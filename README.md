# Haskell Project Mode

This creates a minor mode for managing Haskell projects. I loosely define a "Haskell project" as any directory containing a .cabal file.

Currently, the minor mode does two things:

  * Sets the default M-x compile command to build the project using cabal or cabal-dev as appropriate
  * Automatically creates a custom inferior Haskell buffer using cabal-dev ghci for projects using cabal-dev or cabal repl for projects using cabal sandboxes.

It currently automatically identifies directories that use cabal-dev or cabal sandboxes. If you're using both for whatever unholy reason, it'll default to cabal-dev. (Or maybe it'll just breakâ€”I haven't test this!)

I've found both features useful, particularly since I've started using cabal-dev more and more.

Note: with `cabal-dev`, you have to run `cabal-dev configure` or `cabal-dev install` before using GHCi in a brand new project.

## Installation

First, put `haskell-project-mode.el` into your load-path. Then put the two shell scripts (`ghci-dev` and `ghci-sandbox`) into your path somewhere. Require the mode:

    (require 'haskell-project-mode)

Finally, to automatically enable the mode for `.hs` files, add this to your `.emacs`:

    (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'haskell-project-mode)
