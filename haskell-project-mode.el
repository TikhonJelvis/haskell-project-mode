;;; Commentary:

;; This is a mode for working with Haskell projects. I loosely define
;; "Haskell project" as any directory containing a .cabal file and
;; some Haskell sources. For now, all I'm doing is setting the M-x
;; compile command correctly for the cabal file; in the future, I'll
;; probably add some other things like a command to run tests
;; automatically and maybe a per-project inferior Haskell buffer.
